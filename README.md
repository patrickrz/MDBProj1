# MDBProj1

This app is the first Mini Project for my newbie semester in MDB. It is called "Match the Members" and it is a basic trivia game app that
invites the player to select the correct name for the displayed member picture. The player's score and best streak are kept track of and 
each round, a player has only 5 seconds to guess the member's name correctly before having to move on. The game's button options
will also flash red or green to indicate whether or not the answer choice was selected correctly.
